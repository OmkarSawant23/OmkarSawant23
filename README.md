## 📊 Featured Projects

### 🛒 **Supermarket Sales Forecasting using Time Series Models**

Predicting product-level sales using **ARIMA, SARIMAX, and LSTM models** to improve inventory management, reduce waste, and meet customer demand.
🔹 Techniques: Time Series Analysis, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation
🔹 Tools: Python, Pandas, Statsmodels, TensorFlow

### 🧠 **Neural Machine Translation with Transformers**

Developed an end-to-end **Transformer-based NMT model** using the OPUS Books dataset to translate between English and French, leveraging Hugging Face and PyTorch.
🔹 Techniques: NLP, Sequence-to-Sequence Models, Attention Mechanism
🔹 Tools: Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face, BLEU Evaluation

### 🚀 **Group Project: Kaggle – Spaceship Titanic Classification Challenge**

Worked collaboratively to build machine learning models predicting passenger survival on an interstellar voyage.
🔹 Conducted **data cleaning**, feature extraction, missing value imputation
🔹 Engineered features such as total expenditure, deck-based grouping, and cabin structure
🔹 Tested multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
🔹 Evaluated performance using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and cross-validation
🔹 Built explainability plots to interpret model decisions

This project strengthened my teamwork, version control, and structured experimentation skills — while reinforcing best practices in the ML lifecycle.
